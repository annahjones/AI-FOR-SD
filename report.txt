FULL PROJECT REPORT
Title:
Forecasting Solar Irradiance for Clean Energy Optimization using Machine Learning

SDG Focus:
SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy

Problem Statement
Clean and sustainable energy is essential for future development.
Solar energy offers enormous potential but depends heavily on solar irradiance. Forecasting solar irradiance helps optimize solar panel installations, increase energy production efficiency, and support Kenya’s green energy transition.

Dataset
Source: NASA POWER Data (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/)

Location: Kenya
Time Range: January 2023 — December 2025

Collected Parameters:

ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN (Solar Irradiance, target variable)

T2M (Temperature)

RH2M (Relative Humidity)

WS2M (Wind Speed)

ML Approach
Type: Supervised Learning

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Features used to predict Solar Irradiance:

Temperature at 2 meters (T2M)

Relative Humidity at 2 meters (RH2M)

Wind Speed at 2 meters (WS2M)

Technical Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Converted wide format to long format.

Pivoted data to align all features by date.

Cleaned missing values (-999).

Created date column for time-series plotting.

Model Building:

Train-test split (80/20)

Trained Linear Regression Model

Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, R² metrics.

Model Performance
MAE: 0.29 kWh/m²/day
RMSE: 0.37 kWh/m²/day
R² Score: 0.40

Ethical Reflection
Data Bias: Limited to one location; future work should use larger, global datasets.

Fairness: Promotes equitable access to energy by improving planning.

Sustainability: Accurate forecasts encourage solar energy adoption, reducing fossil fuel reliance.
